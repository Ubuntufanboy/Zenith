# Zenith
An AI interpreter language based off BASIC. No need for memorizing syntax! Just write what you desire! This project was released for Day 4 of Open Source week!

## Open Source Week
Me and the user: zen-ham are releasing a repository every day for 5 days with increasing complexity and interest. These releases were old projects that I never finished and released brought to life!

## Quick bit of honesty...

This interpreter fails to follow instructions and often times makes vastly incorrect judgements. This is because the AI model cannot actually compute anything, it only can imagine the answer. This is a very difficult problem to solve. In future updates, I will fine tune the model to actually call useful APIS to do things with IO and also compute things correctly with a calculator module.

## Potential Usecases

While this program is just for show and isnt practical yet, the usecase of an interpreter is vast. Complex algorithms and weird syntax would all just be as simple as asking. While large LLMs like Claude and ChatGPT exist, They require the use of many package and convoluted installation instructions as well as sometimes just being flat out wrong. Zenith essentially has no syntax, just ask what you want and it will be done.

Imagine saying "play audio.mp3" and all the hardwork was done. No need for finding the best library for playing audio that works on your os or anything!

## Contributing
The whole point of Open Source is to have users modify code and implement new features! I would be honored if somebody were to improve my codebase! Just send a Pull Request and I will review it!
